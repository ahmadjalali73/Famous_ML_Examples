# 4 Shapes
In this Example, we have to predict the shape existed in a picture. our dataset consist of these types of shapes:

- Circle
- Triangle
- Star
- Square

Now, we are trying to solve this problem with Deep Learning algorithms. we will create a simple ANN and we will reach 99.9% accuracy on the training set.

## How to Use

For using this code, you should have these listed packages:

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

for installing these packages, you can use pip. after that, you should download 4shape dataset. you can download it from link below
```

```

after downloading dataset, you should put every directory of shapes under a directory named shapes. This code will open all the images and do the job.

## Result

We will use 'Accuracy' for our metric of validation. Our best accuracy is 99.9%. In the end, we predicted 2960 pictures out of 2970 pictures correctly.
